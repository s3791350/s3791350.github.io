								<b>Name</b><p>Lachlan Fidele</p>
								<b>Student Number</b><p>s3791350</p>
								<b>Email Address</b><p>s3791350@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
								<b>Background Information</b><p>I am half Australian and half Mauritian which is a small island in Africa. The highest education that I have completed is Year 12 VCE and I am working towards completing this degree of Information Technology. The only language I speak is English but I know some Italian because my girlfriend and her parents are from Italy. </p>
								<b>Fact</b><p>I love the sport of basketball and all things video games!</p>

								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<b>What is my interest in IT? When did my interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked my interest? IT experience?</b><p>- I have been interested in IT ever since I was 3 years old when my brother got a PlayStation 2 for Christmas, I loved watching him play it and eventually I started playing it too. IT is my whole life and everything that I love to do is on a computer or on a gaming console. I gained inspiration from people such as Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg as they are some of the most inspirational people in the world, seeing them make these applications and run these companies has inspired me to do the same. The only IT experience that I have is that I used to somewhat build computers a few years ago.</p>
								<b>Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</b><p>- I chose to come to RMIT because from what I have seen and heard from other people it is a really great university for IT, the location of the university is very convenient for me as it is just 2 trains to get to the university. The entirety of RMIT from the education to the people who go there makes me feel at home and makes me feel like I belong as there are all different races, sex and religion within the university.</p>
								<b>What do I expect to learn during my studies?</b><p>-	I expect to learn about IT in all different areas of IT as IT is in everything, I want to learn about everything that you can do with IT and everything that comes with IT as an industry. I hope to learn about how to get a job in this field and what working in IT is like through group projects/assignments and individual assignments too as in the industry you may need to do both group work and individual work to get the job done</p>

							<article id="idealjob">
								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/picidealjob.png" alt="" /></span>
								<b>Description of position</b><p>- The position is appealing to me as it looks like something that I would like to do, as you need experience with coding and that is a thing that I would like to learn, coding in a lot of languages so I can make whatever I would like. The position of software engineer would be harder to get into as I am studying IT and not computer science but at google they take into account your work and not just the degree that you have so if I put in the work I’m sure that I will be able to get this position.</p>
								<b>Description of Skills, qualifications and experience required for the position</b><p>- The skills and qualifications that will be required for the position is things like 2 years of experience in several languages of code including Java, Python, C and C++. Getting this IT degree should help with the process but having a Comp Science degree would be adequate.</p>
								<b>Description of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have</b><p>- At this current point I don’t have very much experience in this field as I have just recently started my University degree in IT and I need to start looking at what skills are required and what I will have to do to obtain the skills and qualifications required.</p>
								<b>Plan describing how skills, qualifications and experience will be obtained.</b><p>- Using this IT course that I am doing I will be able to fulfil some of the requirements of the job including basic programming and how to work as a team in the IT industry. A lot of the skills that I will need such as learning all different languages of code will need to be self taught using different websites and books and this course doesn’t provide that, and if I want to get into this position then I will need to put in the work.</p>

								<b>Myers-Briggs Test</b>

								<b>-What do these results mean to me?</b><p>These results convey to me that I am very introverted and intuitive, this shows me that I am not the type of person to put myself out there or be very open to people that I do not know. By being intuitive this means that I can understand things really well without having to have direct evidence or reasoning to why something is something else. These results really show me how I am and what I can do to change some things about my personality to make it better to work in a group or make my life overall better.</p>
								<b>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</b><p>These results may influence my behaviour in a team as being introverted may hurt me as I won’t communicate as much with my team as I should and keep to myself at times. Being intuitive may help as I will be able to easily agree with other people’s decisions which can make working in a group easier for me and my group members.</p>
								<b>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</b><p>When forming a team, I should make sure that there are multiple different types of people, some introverts and some extroverts as there are multiple different advantages in both types of people. </p>

								<b>Learning Style Test</b>
								
								<img src="images/pictactilelearner.png" alt="" style="width:500px;height:500px">
								<b>What do these results mean to me?</b><p>These results show me that I learn more by touching and doing things rather than listening or writing things down and memorising. This shows me that I should be making moves to do more things to make my memory the best possible such as drawing pictures about the topic or teaching someone else the topic or creating a somewhat game out of what I need to learn so I can learn to the best of my ability.</p>
								<b>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</b><p>These results may influence my behaviour in a team as being a tactile learner would make me want to move around more and create different opportunities which allow me to learn better with my team which can be both fun and can help our group think of new ideas and find answers to current ideas.</p>
								<b>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</b><p>I would want to work with people who are also tactile learners as then we don’t have to consider how other people learn if we all learn the same which can overall make things easier for the group and forming solutions for problems and also coming up with new ideas.</p>

								<b>Career Aptitude Test</b>
								<img src="images/piccareer.png" alt="" style="width:500px;height:500px">
								<b>What do these results mean to me?</b><p>These results show me that I am always looking for the best in any person or situation, and I want to make the world a better place. I always seek the truth and meaning, and I try to live my life in line with my values.</p>
								<b>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</b><p>These results may influence my behaviour in a team as I am always looking for the best in any person which can increase team chemistry and make our team happier which will make them want to work harder and complete the project.</p>
								<b>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</b><p>I would want to work with people who also look for the best in people and want to make the world a better place just so that we can all relate to each other and be the best team possible</p>

								<h2 class="major">Project Idea - Celebrity Shazam</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<b>Overview</b><p>- This project is an application for mobile phones which is much like the popular app shazam which allows you to find out what music is playing at the current time except that this app allows you to find out which celebrity is which. By using this app you can put the camera on a celebrities face and the app will tell you who that celebrity is, have you ever wondered who a celebrity is and couldn’t find them? Well look no further because this app is going to change people’s lives. </p>
								<b>Motivation</b><p>- This project will be useful to people who want to find out who a certain celebrity is. I find myself to be doing this all the time when I see a celebrity in a photo on or video on social media or on the news, this is something that I have wanted to create for a long time, using this new technology it can make it a lot easier for people, you will not need to search google for many minutes or even hours just to find someone. This is an interesting project which can be used by all people of all ages.</p>
								<b>Description</b><p>- The product will allow users to find out what celebrity is what by going onto their phone and using an app which will then open the camera app and users can point the camera at a photo of the celebrity or the video on tv and the app will tell you who the celebrity is, showing a lot of information on that celebrity as well. The app will tell you once a celebrity is scanned and then will give you information such as what music/movies they have been in, other celebrities who are relevant to that person, different facts will also be shown including their age, height and full name. When a user opens the app with only one click of a button they can get to the camera and start scanning celebrity faces, this will give the user ease of access and will make them come back more as they may think of using the app at times but thinking that it will take too long to scan, this app scans both fast and accurately to make sure the user and the app get the best results possible. The app should have a constant colour such as the app shazam has the colour blue, it should have the colour red or something along those lines and show prominence towards the big words like “scan” so that people will know where to press to do certain things rather than searching for a long time to do something. The app will have a history section so you can see what celebrities or people you have searched for in the past in case you have forgotten their name or what they look like. Links will be given to movies or music that the celebrity is in so that you can listen or watch straight away for example if a person is a singer there will be a link to their Spotify or Apple Music and if they are an actor or actress there will be a link to their imdb page or if their movies are available on Netflix or Stan there will be a link to that. There will be multiple tabs with one of the tabs saying something like “Overview” giving the user a summary of what they have used the app for, another tab saying “search” which is where they will search for the celebrity and one more tab saying “discover” this part of the app shows users celebrities that are related to the people they have searched for example they may be in a song or movie together. The app opens up in the search tab so that users can open it and search straight away. There will also be a support page where users can ask for help and they can also suggest new celebrities who maybe aren’t as well-known who can be put on the app if they aren’t already on it. This app will be both effective and efficient and can be useful for a lot of people including myself as I would want something like this app in my life to make things a lot easier for me. </p>
								<b>Tools and Technology</b><p>-	The software is an app on both IPhone and Android so anyone can use it at any time, as long as your phone has a camera the app will work on it. The app will need to be coded in different languages to suit both devices, as android and apple work on different codes. The code for the apple devices will need to be done in the swift programming language and the code for the android devices will need to be done in a coding language such as Java.</p>
								<b>Skills required</b><p>-	The skills required for the project are things like knowledge of coding languages but there will be a team behind it with the skills needed to create the software. The code will need to be written to make the app run and it may be hard to code but the end result will be all worth it. All people involved will have to know how to code or be a part of the marketing team which you would then need those kinds of skills, in all projects there are different people with different skills who each do their part to make the project work.</p>
								<b>Outcome</b><p>-	If the project is successful the outcome will be that people get an app where they can take a photo of what celebrity is what if they do not know who it is, this app will help them. The original problem is solved as people from all around the world can now find out who a celebrity is just by taking a photo of them or showing the camera to the app for it to recognize who that is. The impact that this will have is that people will no longer be searching for hours and hours to find out who someone is and will simply just go to the app and search for the person that they want without wasting hours of their time just to find someone.</p>
